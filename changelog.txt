4.13.1
- changed .pAsymptotic to only use true mixtures (c > 0) in order to avoid numerical problems in large data sets

4.11.3
- cleaned the dependencies in the description file: moved most packages from depends to imports field

- RG fixed up some issues with the vignette. It was using lookUp which means
annotate must be a depends; using mget instead removes that dependency

4.9.2 (2008-04-14)
- added a warning that method = "gamma" is deprecated.
- changed the makeGOstructure function to accomodate the removal of the GOALLENTREZID object from the GO package.
- updated the dependence of GO, KEGG and hu6800 to their .db versions.
- updated the sampling method so that it does not use the gamma z-scores anymore (Thanks to Roel Bakker for the bug report).


4.9.1 (2008-01-14)
- fixed a bug in the "[" method that arose when the permutations version of the test was used (Thanks to Remco Visser for the bug report).
