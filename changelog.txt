4.99.4
- name conflict between new .weed() and deprecated .weed() resolved 
- GOstructure class, makeGOstructure(), and getFocus() placed back (deprecated) for the benefit of the GlobalAncova package
- line lengths of usage in .Rd files adjusted for reference manual
- option(warn.deprecated=FALSE) set in all deprecated .Rd files to avoind warnings during check

4.99.3
- globaltest(), gtGO() and gtKEGG() adapted to accomodate changes to annotation packages
- weights default changed in inheritance()
- arguments of inheritance() renamed

4.99.2
- minsize default in gtGO changed from 0 to 1
- focusLevel also proof against empty subsets

4.99.1
- Empty subset now gives NA p-value rather than error.

4.99.0
- Complete rewrite of the package: all function have been replaced, old ones deprecated
- New vignette
- New feature: complete support of formula-based calls to "gt" (was: globaltest)
- New feature: improved asymptotic null distribution for glms
- New feature: exact distribution for linear model
- New feature: inheritance method for multiple testing
- New feature: focus level method available outside GO context
- New feature: P-values, dendrogram and inheritance mutiple testing in "covariates" function (was: geneplot)
- New feature: P-values and dendrogram in "subjects" function (was: sampleplot)
- New feature: functions gtKEGG, gtGO, gtBroad for easier gene set testing.

4.15.1
- fixed bug in geneplot that deleted gene labels of single gene gene sets

4.13.1
- changed .pAsymptotic to only use true mixtures (c > 0) in order to avoid numerical problems in large data sets

4.11.3
- cleaned the dependencies in the description file: moved most packages from depends to imports field

- RG fixed up some issues with the vignette. It was using lookUp which means
annotate must be a depends; using mget instead removes that dependency

4.9.2 (2008-04-14)
- added a warning that method = "gamma" is deprecated.
- changed the makeGOstructure function to accomodate the removal of the GOALLENTREZID object from the GO package.
- updated the dependence of GO, KEGG and hu6800 to their .db versions.
- updated the sampling method so that it does not use the gamma z-scores anymore (Thanks to Roel Bakker for the bug report).


4.9.1 (2008-01-14)
- fixed a bug in the "[" method that arose when the permutations version of the test was used (Thanks to Remco Visser for the bug report).
