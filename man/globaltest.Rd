\title{Global Test}

\description{In microarray data, tests a (list of) group(s) of 
genes for significant association with a given clinical variable.}

\usage{globaltest(X, Y, test.genes = NULL, model = 'logistic', 
    levels = NULL, permutation = FALSE, nperm = NULL, 
    sampling = FALSE, ndraws = NULL, verbose = TRUE) }

\arguments{
    \item{X}{A matrix of gene expression data, where columns correspond to
samples and rows to genes or a Bioconductor exprSet. The data 
should be properly normalized beforehand (and log- or otherwise 
transformed), but missing values are allowed (coded as 
\code{NA}). Gene and sample names can be included as the row and 
column names of \code{X}.}
    \item{Y}{A vector with the clinical outcome of interest, having one value
for each sample, or the name of a covariate in the phenoData slot of the exprSet}
    \item{test.genes}{Either a vector or a list of vectors. Indicates 
the group(s) of genes to be tested. Each vector in 
\code{test.genes} can be given in three formats. Either it can be 
a vector with 1 (\code{TRUE}) or 0 (\code{FALSE}) for each gene 
in \code{X}, with 1 indicating that the gene belongs to the 
group. Or it can be a vector containing the column numbers (in 
\code{X}) of the genes belonging to the group. Or it can be a 
subset of the rownames for \code{X}.}
    \item{model}{Indicates the model the test uses: 
Use \code{model = 'logistic'} for a two-valued outcome \code{Y} 
(the default) or \code{model = 'linear'} for a continuous 
outcome.}
    \item{levels}{If Y is a exprSet covariate and contains more than 2 levels:
levels is a vector of length 2 with the subgroups to test }
    \item{permutation}{A logical flag. If \code{TRUE} \code{nperm} 
permutations are used to calculate the p-value instead of the 
asymptotic formulas. Recommended for small sample sizes.}
    \item{nperm}{The number permutations used. The default is 10,000. 
If a number is specified for \code{nperm}, \code{permutation} is 
automatically set to \code{TRUE}.}
    \item{sampling}{A logical flag. If \code{TRUE} \code{ndraws} 
random sets of genes are drawn with the same number of genes as 
the tested group. Using this draws, an extra column of output 
\code{comparative.p} is generated, reporting how many of these 
random sets have a lower p-value than the tested group.}
    \item{ndraws}{The number of random groups of genes to be drawn.
The default is 1,000. If a number is specified for \code{ndraws},
\code{sampling} is automatically set to \code{TRUE}.}
    \item{verbose}{Prints some progress information if set to TRUE}.}

\details{The Global Test tests whether a group of genes (of any 
size from one single gene to all genes on the array) is 
significantly associated with a clinical outcome. The group could 
be for example a known pathway, an area on the genome or the set 
of all genes. The test investigates whether samples with similar 
clinical outcomes tend to have similar gene expression patterns. 
For a significant result it is not necessary that the genes in 
the group have similar expression patterns, only that many of 
them are correlated with the outcome.}

\note{If the number of rows of \code{X} does not match the length 
of the vector \code{Y}, but the number of columns does, the
matrix \code{X} given is tacitly replaced by \code{t(X)} to make
\code{X} and \code{Y} match. A warning is printed if \code{X} is
square.}

\value{The function returns an object of class 
\code{\link{gt.result-class}}.}
